# Cryptography of Julius Caesar
According to Wikipedia, cryptography or cryptology (in Greek: kryptós, "hidden", and gráphein, "writing") is the study and practice of principles and techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties, called "opponents." But generally, cryptography refers to the construction and analysis of protocols that prevent third parties, or the public, from reading private messages. Many aspects of information security such as confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Encryption applications include ecommerce, chip-based payment cards, digital coins, computer passwords, and military communications. From the most curious Cryptographies in the history of humanity we can cite the cryptography used by the great Roman military leader Julius Caesar to communicate with his generals. This encryption is based on replacing the letter of the advanced alphabet with a certain number of houses. For example, considering the number of houses = 3:

## Normal: a slight brown fox jumped on the tired dog

## Encryption: d oljhlud udsrvd pduurp vdowrx vreuh r fdfkruur fdqvdgr

## Rules
Messages will be converted to lowercase for both encryption and decryption.
In our case the numbers and points will be kept, that is:
Normal: 1a.a

The goal of this challenge is to automate the encryption and decryption of these mentions:
